# Predicting-Modelling-For-Liver-Disease-Detection
This project uses machine learning to predict liver disease based on patient health data. After testing 8 models, Gradient Boosting gave the best results with 92% accuracy and 96% recall. The model is saved and can predict liver disease for new patients using basic inputs.
